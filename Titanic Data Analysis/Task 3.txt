3. In this problem statement we will find the number of male and female people died in each class

DATA = LOAD '/home/acadgild/data/TitanicData.txt' using PigStorage(',') as (PassengerId:int, Survived:int, Pclass:int, Name:chararray, Sex:chararray, Age:int ,SibSp:int, parch:int, Ticket:chararray, Fare:float, Cabin:chararray, Embarked:chararray);
NumDied = FILTER DATA BY Survived == 1;

MenDied = FILTER NumDied BY Sex == 'male';
GrpMen = GROUP MenDied ALL;
CntMen = FOREACH GrpMen GENERATE COUNT(MenDied);

WomenDied = FILTER NumDied BY Sex == 'female';
GrpWomen = GROUP WomenDied ALL;
CntWomen = FOREACH GrpWomen GENERATE COUNT(WomenDied);

DUMP CntMen;
Output : (109)

DUMP CntWomen;
Output : (233)
